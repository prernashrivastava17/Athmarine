                  We’re cultivating a space for a maritime community that wants
                  to play a part in changing how the maritime world works
                  together. We are building a global network of service
                  providers and maritime professionals across the globe, who use
                  Ath Marine every day to ensure their vessels sail safely and
                  efficiently. We’re inspired by each and every one of our
                  Partners. We value their perspectives, beliefs, and views—they
                  are what makes Ath Marine so dynamic.

                  In order to maintain a respectful, inclusive, and safe
                  environment for everyone, we’ve created a set of standards to
                  serve as a moral compass for behaviour on our platform. These
                  standards help define what is acceptable in the Ath Marine
                  maritime community and marketplace, both in face-to-face
                  interactions and online communications. They aren’t tied to
                  any law but are used to govern our platform policies. They
                  reflect our attitudes, expectations, and social norms. Our
                  maritime community standards are rooted in our core values —
                  respect, safety, acceptance, support, and open-mindedness.

                <p className="para">
                  Just like our maritime community, these standards will
                  continue to grow, evolve, and change. We have embedded
                  examples in the maritime community standards for unacceptable
                  activities on Ath Marine. Please note that these are intended
                  to be examples only and not a complete list.

                  We encourage our maritime community to use our reporting tools
                  when encountering anything that is unacceptable. We want to
                  create the best experience for all maritime community members
                  and ask that you respect and follow these guidelines.
